Description: This package gives the implementations of the gene
        expression signature and its distance to each. Gene expression
        signature is represented as a list of genes whose expression is
        correlated with a biological state of interest. And its
        distance is defined using a nonparametric, rank-based
        pattern-matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
        statistic. Gene expression signature and its distance can be
        used to detect similarities among the signatures of drugs,
        diseases, and biological states of interest.
